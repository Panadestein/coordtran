Coordtran
=========

This small module provides the necessary functions to perform coordinate transformations in a 9D molecular system (van der Waals complexes, to be more specific). The functions can be used to transform internal coordinates to Cartesian (and vice versa) for any triatomic molecule over a *frozen* molecular surface. The main idea behind the process is the computation of Euler angles between coordinate frames obtained by diagonalization of inertia tensor matrices. 

Some documentation is available through Sphinx and some unit test have been implemented.
